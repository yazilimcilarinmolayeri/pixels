```
Or you can simply download the files [here](https://github.com/yazilimcilarinmolayeri/pixels/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)...

## Configuration

After you clone this repository or simply downloaded the files, you must fill in the required configuration fields in `appsettings.Development.json`. Then run the SQL script named `Structure.sql` on your **PostgreSQL** server.

You can change listening ports `Properties/launchSettings.json` Here is the default ports for each environment:

| Environment | HTTP | HTTPS |
| - | - | - |
| Development | `7000` | `7001` |
| Production | `5000` | `5001` |

## Building

You can build the project using launch profiles.

If you want to build the project using **development** environment, execute:
```shell
$ dotnet run --launch-profile "Development"
```
If you want to build the project using **production** environment, execute:
```shell
$ dotnet run --launch-profile "Production"
```

## Endpoints

There are few endpoints which users can use.
  
| Endpoint | Description |
| - | - |
| `/api/canvas` | Users can execute a `GET` request here to fetch currently active canvases image. |
| `/api/pixel` | Users can execute a `PUT` request here with a `SetPixelModel` object to put a pixel to currently active canvas. |
| `/api/pixel/{x}-{y}` | Users can execute a `GET` request here to fetch the pixel information on currently active canvas. |
| `/api/auth/login` | Users must login and get a `jwt` token from this endpoint in order to use the API. This endpoint simply redirects the user to Discord OAuth authentication page. |
| `/api/auth/discord/callback` | Users will come to this endpoint after they authenticate with their Discord account. This endpoint will authenticate them using a `jwt` token. |

Example of a `SetPixelModel` object: `{"x": 10, "y": 15, "color": "f30a2b"}`
